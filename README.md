# 🌍 Global Alignment Index (GAI)

The **Global Alignment Index** is a public, factual, and opinion-free dashboard that tracks whether humanity is becoming more aligned — or less aligned — over time.

### Purpose
- Provide a **clear, neutral measurement** of alignment across critical domains.
- Anchor in **undebatable, direction-clear metrics** (e.g., literacy ↑ better, conflicts ↓ better).
- Compare **Alignment vs Capability growth** to reveal whether resonance is keeping pace with power.

### Domains & Metrics (v1)
- **Peace & Geopolitics** → armed conflicts, battle deaths, displacement  
- **Climate & Environment** → CO₂ ppm, sea level  
- **Economics & Poverty** → extreme poverty, income share bottom 50%, unemployment  
- **Education & Digital Access** → literacy, out-of-school children, internet use  
- **Health & Wellbeing** → life expectancy, child & maternal mortality  
- **Safety & Civic Space** → homicide rate, journalists imprisoned  
- **Water & Sanitation** → safe drinking water, sanitation access  
- **Disasters & Displacement** → disaster fatalities, people affected  

### Capability Metrics
To compare alignment with the speed of growth:
- GDP per capita (PPP)  
- Energy use per capita  
- R&D expenditure % GDP  
- AI/tech diffusion (internet, compute, patents)

### Features (v1)
- Clean one-page dashboard (Next.js + Tailwind + Recharts)  
- Public JSON datasets and API endpoints  
- Weekly automated refresh (GitHub Actions + Python fetchers)  
- Transparent **Methods** and **Changelog**  
- Embeddable charts for researchers, NGOs, and journalists  

### Roadmap
- v0.1 → Mock dashboard shell (visible now)  
- v1.0 → First real metrics, Alignment Index, Capability Index, gap line  
- Later → premium features (multi-country compare, CSV/API export, alerts)
